# TaskScheduler1
This simple task scheduler allows users to interact with a text-based menu. They can add tasks, view tasks, mark tasks as complete (which changes their status from "❌" to "✔"), delete tasks, and exit the scheduler. It demonstrates basic usage of classes, user input handling, and simple task management functionalities in Python.
